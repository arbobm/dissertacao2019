\usepackage[none]{hyphenat}
\pagestyle{plain}
\raggedbottom 

% \usepackage[none]{hyphenat} turns off hyphenation of words across multiple lines as I’m not a fan of this. \pagestyle{plain} removes section headings from the top of pages as I wanted a simple look. Finally, \raggedbottom prevents LaTeX from varying the spacing between paragraphs to minimise empty space on pages. Personally, I think the variable spacing looks a bit odd, so I turned it off.
