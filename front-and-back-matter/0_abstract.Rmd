Watershed classification using spatial representations of biodiversity threatening factors are useful as proxies of disturbance gradients. However, this is an assumption that should be tested in order to effectively link conservation objectives to biodiversity outcomes. In this study, we test whether stream fish community attributes are related to environmental pressure in small watersheds of the Brazilian Pampa grassland biome. Firstly, we estimated and mapped environmental pressure in 3359 third-order watersheds, then we tested whether environmental pressure predicted fish community attributes in 150-m stream segments from 52 watersheds representing the gradient of environmental pressure. Environmental pressure was defined by an index based on six indicators (cropland, mining, urbanization, road density, dams and cattle density). We defined reference watersheds as those where all the indicators were equal to zero or which were ranked among the 10% less disturbed in each subregional Pampa unit (aquatic ecorregions and regional grassland types). All watersheds had the influence of at least one disturbance factor, and reference watersheds were indentified in only one subregional unit. An elevated fraction of the watersheds (over 50%) showed intermediate to high pressure. Redundancy Analysis (RDA) indicated that that taxonomic composition was related to cropland area and dams. GLM results indicated that taxonomic richness is negatively related to cropland area. Functional richness and composition, and proportion of rare and common species were not related to the environmental pressure gradient. Our results show that response of fish communities to environmental pressure gradient may vary from positive, to negative or no response, depending on the selected attribute. Concerning the use in scientifically defensible conservation strategies, mapping pressure indicators could be enhanced by testing their relationship with conservation biodiversity outcomes.
