abstract = {We examined relations between cumulative levels of forest harvesting and density of road networks on the occurrence and abundance of bull trout (Salvelinus confluentus) in the Kakwa River Basin, Alberta. Logistic regression models showed that bull trout occurrence was positively related to stream wetted width but negatively related to percent fines, percent cobbles, reach slope, and the cumulative area of the subbasin harvested and road density. Results from zero-inflated Poisson regression models typically showed that bull trout abundance was positively related to elevation and negatively related to stream width, percent fines, percent cobble, slope, and levels of forest harvesting. Using the negative relation between bull trout occurrence and percentage of subbasins harvested derived from the most parsimonious logistic regression model, we forecasted that forest harvesting over the next 20 years is projected to result in the local extirpation of bull trout from 24{\%} to 43{\%} of stream reaches that currently support bull trout in the Kakwa River Basin.},

abstract = {Spatial representations of threatening processes - "threat maps" - can identify where biodiversity is at risk, and are often used to identify priority locations for conservation. In doing so, decision makers are prone to making errors, either by assuming that the level of threat dictates spatial priorities for action or by relying primarily on the location of mapped threats to choose possible actions. We show that threat mapping can be a useful tool when incorporated within a transparent and repeatable structured decision-making (SDM) process. SDM ensures transparent and defendable conservation decisions by linking objectives to biodiversity outcomes, and by considering constraints, consequences of actions, and uncertainty. If used to make conservation decisions, threat maps are best developed with an understanding of how species respond to actions that mitigate threats. This approach will ensure that conservation actions are prioritized where they are most cost-effective or have the greatest impact, rather than where threat levels are highest.},

abstract = {Reversal of widespread fish habitat degradation in the conterminous United States will require effective spatial planning, which begins with spatial assessment of current habitat conditions. We present an assessment of cumulative anthropogenic disturbance to fish habitats in approximately 2.23 million U.S. river reaches under the assumption that downstream local habitat conditions will reflect conditions in the catchment upstream. We used geographic information systems data to attribute 15 disturbance variables to the catchments of mapped river reaches to calibrate an index of cumulative disturbance that considered effects originating from both local and upstream catchments. The influence of each variable was adjusted in the index based on the results of multiple linear regression analyses of all variables against percent intolerant fishes at a site—a commonly used biological indicator of habitat condition. Urban landscape indicators were weighted most heavily, followed by point-source pollution, pasture lands, and dam densities. Local factors were found to be less influential on fishes than those originating from the upstream river network. Skewed cumulative disturbance scores indicated that disturbance levels of some reaches far exceeded the national median. Future assessments should include stratification of analyses within regions, expanded use of response metrics and datasets, and alternative analytical approaches to help tease apart the influences of interacting landscape disturbance types. We demonstrate how our results can be visualized and used to make regional comparisons among large-scale planning units and also show how reachlevel information about upstream versus local disturbance levels can be used to identify potential habitat management strategies that are suitable to different landscape contexts.},

abstract = {Mining impacts on stream systems have historically been studied over small spatial scales, yet investigations over large areas may be useful for characterizing mining as a regional source of stress to stream fishes. The associations between co-occurring stream fish assemblages and densities of various "classes " of mining occurring in the same catchments were tested using threshold analysis. Threshold analysis identifies the point at which fish assemblages change substantially from best available habitat conditions with increasing disturbance. As this occurred over large regions, species comprising fish assemblages were represented by various functional traits as well as other measures of interest to management (characterizing reproductive ecology and life history, habitat preferences, trophic ecology, assemblage diversity and evenness, tolerance to anthropogenic disturbance and state-recognized game species). We used two threshold detection methods: change-point analysis with indicator analysis and piecewise linear regression. We accepted only those thresholds that were highly statistically significant (p≤0.01) for both techniques and overlapped within ≤5{\%} error. We found consistent, wedge-shaped declines in multiple fish metrics with increasing levels of mining in catchments, suggesting mines are a regional source of disturbance. Threshold responses were consistent across the three ecoregions occurring at low mine densities. For 47.2{\%} of the significant thresholds, a density of only ≤0.01 mines/km2 caused a threshold response. In fact, at least 25{\%} of streams in each of our three study ecoregions have mine densities in their catchments with the potential to affect fish assemblages. Compared to other anthropogenic impacts assessed over large areas (agriculture, impervious surface or urban land use), mining had a more pronounced and consistent impact on fish assemblages.},

abstract = {Aim Using a probabilistic modelling framework, we aimed to incorporate landscape spatiotemporal dynamics into reserve design. We employed a spatially explicit stochastic model, which integrates both hydrological and biological processes, to simulate the wetland's biological succession. Location Pantanal wetland (with 140,000 km2) between Brazil, Bolivia and Paraguay. Methods We used the reserve design software Marxan to optimize the current and future representation (up to 50 years) of 20{\%} of five plant communities with maximum reliability (i.e. smallest uncertainty). The Kappa statistic was used to compare selection frequencies of individual sites through a set of planning timeframes (5, 17, 25 and 50 years) and the likely pattern of biological succession over these periods. Results Solutions based on static vegetation distributions were significantly dissimilar from solutions based on the expected modelled changes resulting from the flood disturbance and succession dynamics. Increasing the required reliability of biodiversity outcomes resulted in more expensive reserve solutions. We demonstrated the flexibility of probabilistic decision-making methods to illuminate the trade-offs between reliability and efficiency of site selection. Main conclusions Considering the importance of habitat heterogeneity to the principles and practice of systematic conservation planning, it is notable that landscape dynamics have not been a central theme in conservation planning. In the case of the Pantanal hydrosere, acknowledging and planning for temporal dynamics required an ability to model succession and define acceptable levels of outcome reliability, but ultimately improved the long-term Adequacy of resulting reserve networks.

@article{Overbeck2006,
abstract = {In regularly burned grassland on Morro Santana, Porto Alegre, RS, Brazil, we investigated differences in the floristic composition and their relation to soil properties, aspect and distance from the forest border. In 48 plots of 0.75 m², we identified a total of 201 species from a local species pool of approximately 450 to 500 species. Most species occurred in low frequencies, showing clumpy distribution patterns in the studied area. Multivariate analysis showed that plots close to the forest edge clearly differed from plots in the open grassland concerning composition and structure. Plots exposed to the north differed from plots on the top of the hill both in the composition of species as well as in soil variables, mainly due to shallower soil in the former. No strong relation between soil properties and variation in vegetation composition could be detected at a finer scale. The studied grassland, as all grassland vegetation in southern Brazil, is very rich in species compared to other grassland formations worldwide. However, this high biodiversity and conservational value of Campos vegetation in general has so far not been recognized properly. Disturbance is essential to maintain this open vegetation type and its species richness. Fire should be considered as a management option in the absence of grazing.},

@article{Lavorel2007a,
abstract = {Interpreting the functional diversity of vegetation is important in unravelling the relationship between environmental change, community composition and ecosystem processes. Functional diversity is the range and distribution of functional trait values in a community. It can be described, among other indicators, by community-level weighted means of trait values (CWM) and functional divergence. Standard methods exist for trait measurements but not for assessments of CWM and functional divergence in the field. No research has addressed the effects of different methods of estimating relative abundances, nor the need to estimate traits at individual, population or species level, or whether methods could be used that bypass taxonomy all together. This study reviews and evaluates plot-level assessment methods of functional diversity in herbaceous vegetation. We asked: (i) Should the objective of the study influence the method for estimating relative abundance? (ii) What are the strengths and limitations of intensive vs. 'rapid' approaches, and when should either be applied? (iii) Are taxon-free methods robust in comparison to taxon-explicit methods of trait measurement? Under what circumstances might they be applied? Our review of published studies that have measured functional diversity in the field showed that the choice of metric has not generally taken into account the link between the metric and the functions of interest, and that vegetation cover has been most widely used, regardless of study purpose. We compared quantitatively in subalpine grasslands three methods for quantification of species abundances plus one taxon-free method. We found that: (i) data base trait values were robust across years for a diverse set of dominant species; (ii) CWM have little sensitivity to method for estimating relative abundances; this sensitivity also depends on traits, for example, seed mass results were less stable than leaf traits and heights; (iii) robust estimates of CWM were obtained from visual estimates of species ranks and biomass using a dry-weight ranking method (BOTANAL), whereas functional divergence was more sensitive to method; and (iv) the taxon-free method should be treated with more caution and performed particularly poorly for estimates of functional divergence. We conclude that methodology can affect estimates of functional diversity. Although care should be taken in the choice of method and interpretation of results, rapid methods often offer promising avenues for sampling larger areas and/or repeated measures.},

abstract = {Systematic Conservation Planning provides a clear, comprehensive guide to the process of deriving conservation area networks that will represent biodiversity in cost-effective ways. The measurement of biodiversity, the design of field collections to sample biodiversity and data treatment methods together provide baseline information on the distribution patterns of biodiversity. The book then describes methods for identifying biodiversity priority areas underpinned by the concept of complementarity. It goes on to describe how biodiversity targets can be set and how multi-criteria analyses can incorporate costs and other constraints into the area selection process, enabling trade-offs between production and protection to be made. The book finishes with a series of case studies and a conclusion that emphasizes the socio-economic and cultural contexts in which conservation planning takes place. A clear procedure is provided for identifying biodiversity priority areas, underpinned by current best science practice and sound common sense, making this volume of interest not only to graduate students and academic conservation biologists, but also planners and decision-makers dealing with natural resource management together with conservation NGOs.},

abstract = {Global biodiversity in river and riparian ecosystems is generated and maintained by geographic variation in stream processes and fluvial disturbance regimes, which largely reflect regional differences in climate and geology. Extensive construction of dams by humans has greatly dampened the seasonal and interannual streamflow variability of rivers, thereby altering natural dynamics in ecologically important flows on continental to global scales. The cumulative effects of modification to regional-scale environmental templates caused by dams is largely unexplored but of critical conservation importance. Here, we use 186 long-term streamflow records on intermediate-sized rivers across the continental United States to show that dams have homogenized the flow regimes on third- through seventh-order rivers in 16 historically distinctive hydrologic regions over the course of the 20th century. This regional homogenization occurs chiefly through modification of the magnitude and timing of ecologically critical high and low flows. For 317 undammed reference rivers, no evidence for homogenization was found, despite documented changes in regional precipitation over this period. With an estimated average density of one dam every 48 km of third- through seventh-order river channel in the United States, dams arguably have a continental scale effect of homogenizing regionally distinct environmental templates, thereby creating conditions that favor the spread of cosmopolitan, nonindigenous species at the expense of locally adapted native biota. Quantitative analyses such as ours provide the basis for conservation and management actions aimed at restoring and maintaining native biodiversity and ecosystem function and resilience for regionally distinct ecosystems at continental to global scales.},

abstract = {Protecting the world's freshwater resources requires diagnosing threats over a broad range of scales, from global to local. Here we present the first worldwide synthesis to jointly consider human and biodiversity perspectives on water security using a spatial framework that quantifies multiple stressors and accounts for downstream impacts. We find that nearly 80{\%} of the world's population is exposed to high levels of threat to water security. Massive investment in water technology enables rich nations to offset high stressor levels without remedying their underlying causes, whereas less wealthy nations remain vulnerable. A similar lack of precautionary investment jeopardizes biodiversity, with habitats associated with 65{\%} of continental discharge classified as moderately to highly threatened. The cumulative threat framework offers a tool for prioritizing policy and management responses to this crisis, and underscores the necessity of limiting threats at their source instead of through costly remediation of symptoms in order to assure global water security for both humans and freshwater biodiversity.},

abstract = {ABSTRACT: Fish diets provide information that can be used to explore and model complex ecosys- tems, and infer resource partitioning among species. The exhaustive sampling of prey items captured by each species remains, however, a demanding task. Therefore, predicting diets from other vari- ables, such as functional traits, may be a valuable method. Here, we attempted to predict trophic guild and diet overlap for 35 fish species using 13 ecomorphological traits related to feeding ecology. We compared linear discriminant analysis and random forest (RF) classifiers in their ability to predict trophic guild. We used generalized dissimilarity modelling to predict diet overlap from functional dis- tances between species pairs. All models were evaluated using the same cross-validation procedure. We found that fish trophic guilds were accurately predicted by an RF classifier, even with a limited number of traits, when no more than 7 guilds were defined. Prediction was no longer accurate when finer trophic guilds were created (8 or more guilds), whatever the combination of traits. Furthermore, predicting the degree of diet dissimilarity between species pairs, based on their ecomorphological traits dissimilarities, was profoundly unreliable (at least 76{\%} of unexplained variation). These results suggest that we can predict fish trophic guilds accurately from ecomorphological traits, but not diet overlap and resource partitioning because of inherent versatility in fish diets. More generally, our sta- tistical framework may be applied to any kind of marine organism for which feeding strategies need to be determined from traits. KEY},

abstract = {One of the most pervasive forms of uncertainty in data used to make conservation decisions is error associated with mapping of conservation features. Whilst conservation planners should consider uncertainty associated with ecological data to make informed decisions, mapping error is rarely, if ever, accommodated in the planning process. Here, we develop a spatial conservation prioritization approach that accounts for the uncertainty inherent in coral reef habitat maps and apply it in the Kubulau District fisheries management area, Fiji. We use accuracy information describing the probability of occurrence of each habitat type, derived from remote sensing data validated by field surveys, to design a marine reserve network that has a high probability of protecting a fixed percentage (10-90{\%}) of every habitat type. We compare the outcomes of our approach to those of standard reserve design approaches, where habitat-mapping errors are not known or ignored. We show that the locations of priority areas change between the standard and probabilistic approaches, with errors of omission and commission likely to occur if reserve design does not accommodate mapping accuracy. Although consideration of habitat mapping accuracy leads to bigger reserve networks, they are unlikely to miss habitat conservation targets. We explore the trade-off between conservation feature representation and reserve network area, with smaller reserve networks possible if we give up on trying to meet targets for habitats mapped with a low accuracy. The approach can be used with any habitat type at any scale to inform more robust and defensible conservation decisions in marine or terrestrial environments. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {Characterizing the relative severity of human disturbance in watersheds is often part of stream assessments and is frequently done with the aid of Geographic Information System (GIS)-derived data. However, the choice of variables and how they are used to quantify disturbance are often subjective. In this study, we developed a number of disturbance indices by testing sets of variables, scoringmethods, and weightings of 33 potential disturbance factors derived from readily available GIS data. The indices were calibrated using 770 watersheds located in the western United States for which the severity of disturbance had previously been classified from detailed local data by the United States Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) Environmental Monitoring and Assessment Program (EMAP). The indices were calibrated by determining which variable or variable combinations and aggregation method best differentiated between least- andmost-disturbed sites. Indices composed of several variables performed better than any individual variable, and best results came from a threshold method of scoring using six uncorrelated variables: housing unit density, road density, pesticide application,damstorage, land cover along a mainstembuffer, and distance to nearest canal/pipeline. The final index was validated with 192 withheld watersheds and correctly classified about two-thirds (68{\%}) of least- andmost-disturbed sites. These results provide information about the potential for using a disturbance index as a screening tool for a priori ranking of watersheds at a regional/national scale, and which landscape variables and methods of combination may be most helpful in doing so},

- point-source pollution
- conversion of natural vegetation to developed land
- nutrient and pesticide input from agricultural and urban sources

(2) how or if they should be weighted, and
(3) how data values should be translated to an index score.

- REF = representative of near natural or least disturbed conditions in their respective ecoregions
- DIS = representative of the most altered or modified by human activities

Scoring methods: 3 methods
1) range-standardize scoring method: a variable were standardized to range from 0 to 10 to produce raw disturbance scores. The raw scores were multiplied by a weighting factor (see below), then summed for all variables included in the index. The summed values were then standardized again so that the final index values ranged from 0 (lowest disturbance) to 10 (highest disturbance). every data value that is greater than 0 contributes to the overall disturbance score.

Most important are flows and movements, e.g., in wildlife corridors, across the land. Landscape ecology provides a useful theoretical framework for such a transportation analysis. Road density (e.g., mi/sq mi) is a useful summary index, because it integrates so many ecological impacts of roads and vehicles. A road density effect on wildlife is illustrated. Suburban, open, and forested landscapes are shown to have markedly different road effects on species, habitat, water, soil, and atmosphere. Roads cause more effects and have a greater cumulative effect than vehicles. A planning framework used in Holland is outlined, which maps the landscape ecological network, superimposes the road network, identifies bottlenecks, examines stretches of road and landscape in detail, and uses an array of ecological and technological solutions for avoidance, mitigation, and compensation. Major mitigation techniques, including diverse tunnels, overpasses, and landscape connectors are outlined, along with animals using them. Very little of this ecological technology yet exists in the United States. A brief opportunity remains to lead the public, by concurrently implementing successful existing technology, researching road ecology, and educating the public.},

abstract = {The biological integrity of stream ecosystems depends critically on human activities that affect land usekover along stream margins and possibly throughout the catchment. We evaluated stream condition using an Index of Biotic Integrity (IBI) and a habitat index (HI), and compared these measures to landscape and riparian conditions assessed at different spatial scales in a largely agricultural Midwestern watershed. Our goal was to determine whether land usekover was an effective predictor of stream integrity, and if so, at what spatial scale. Twenty-three sites in first-through third-order headwater streams were surveyed by electrofishing and site IBIS were calculated based on ten metrics of the fish collection. Habitat features were characterized through field observation, and site HIS calculated from nine instream and bank metrics. Field surveys, aerial photograph interpretation, and geographic information system (GIS) analyses provided assessments of forested land and other vegetation covers at the local, reach, and regional (catchment) scales. The range of conditions among the 23 sites varied from poor to very good based on IBI and HI scores, and habitat and fish assemblage measures were highly correlated. Stream biotic integrity and habitat quality were negatively correlated with the extent of agriculture and positively correlated with extent of wetlands and forest. Correlations were strongest at the catchment scale (IBI with {\%} area as agriculture, r2 = 0.50, HI with agriculture, r2 = 0.76), and tended to become weak and non-significant at local scales. Local riparian vegetation was a weak secondary predictor of stream integrity. In this watershed, regional land use is the primary determinant of stream conditions, able to overwhelm the ability of local site vegetation to support high-quality habitat and biotic communities.},

Whole watershed land use in the 1950s was the best predictor of present-day diversity, whereas riparian land use and watershed land use in the 1990s were comparatively poor indicators. Our findings indicate that past land-use activity, particularly agriculture, may result in long-term modifications to and reductions in aquatic diversity, regardless of reforestation of riparian zones.

abstract = {Average species richness for fish taxocenes in the Nida River (Poland), Grand River (Ontario) and Baram River (Sarawak, Malaysia) was 7, 16 and 24 species respectively. Discriminant analysis of 15 morphological attributes indicated Baram fishes partitioned the habitat vertically into mainly surface, pelagic, benthic and substratum niche types. Attribute comparisons among the river systems revealed a progression towards more sedentary benthic morphologies with increasing average species richness. Similarly, niche compression as a consequence of increasing average species richness was indicated by a reduction in length of life and average size, and was associated with development of complex life-history and reproductive styles. Total niche space occupied by the fish taxocenes was comparable in the three river systems despite differences in species richness. The amount of species packing and niche space occupied by Baram fish taxocenes were also not related to the numbers of species present. Fish community structure was apparently determined by the range of available resources and the associated specializations of the coexisting species.},

abstract = {The inverse system approximation using the finite impulse responses (FIR) and the corresponding model-order determination are essential to a broad area of science and technology utilizing signal processing. To the best of our knowledge, there exists no explicit formulation of the exact L2 approximation error for the truncated inverse filters. The approach to determine the minimum inverse model-order subject to the maximum allowable L2 approximation error is also in demand. In this paper, we present two L2 approximation error measures and the two corresponding optimal finite-support approximates. Also, we derive the explicit L2 approximation error functions with respect to roots, multiplicities and model orders for these two kinds of approximates. Then, we propose a new algorithm to determine the minimum total model order of the appropriate truncated inverse filter to achieve a specified L2 approximation error. Our newly derived L2 approximation error evaluation method can be employed for signal processing, telecommunication, control systems involving the inverse filtering in the future. Besides, our novel model-order determination algorithm can be utilized for efficient dynamic memory allocation in a wide variety of applications since such a minimum total model order is proportional to the memory usage for any inverse filter implementation.},

abstract = {Functional diversity is increasingly identified as an important driver of ecosystem functioning. Various indices have been proposed to measure the functional diversity of a community, but there is still no consensus on which are most suitable. Indeed, none of the existing indices meets all the criteria required for general use. The main criteria are that they must be designed to deal with several traits, take into account abundances, and measure all the facets of functional diversity. Here we propose three indices to quantify each facet of functional diversity for a community with species distributed in a multidimensional functional space: functional richness (volume of the functional space occupied by the community), functional evenness (regularity of the distribution of abundance in this volume), and functional divergence (divergence in the distribution of abundance in this volume). Functional richness is estimated using the existing convex hull volume index. The new functional evenness index is based on the minimum spanning tree which links all the species in the multidimensional functional space. Then this new index quantifies the regularity with which species abundances are distributed along the spanning tree. Functional divergence is measured using a novel index which quantifies how species diverge in their distances (weighted by their abundance) from the center of gravity in the functional space. We show that none of the indices meets all the criteria required for a functional diversity index, but instead we show that the set of three complementary indices meets these criteria. Through simulations of artificial data sets, we demonstrate that functional divergence and functional evenness are independent of species richness and that the three functional diversity indices are independent of each other. Overall, our study suggests that decomposition of functional diversity into its three primary components provides a meaningful framework for its quantification and for the classification of existing functional diversity indices. This decomposition has the potential to shed light on the role of biodiversity on ecosystem functioning and on the influence of biotic and abiotic filters on the structure of species communities. Finally, we propose a general framework for applying these three functional diversity indices.},

abstract = {Roads are pervasive in modern landscapes and adversely affect many aquatic ecosystems. Conventional environmental assessments of roads focus on construction impacts but ignore subsequent impacts. A comprehensive framework for considering all impacts of roads would enable scientists and managers to develop assessment tools that more accu- rately inform stakeholders and policymakers about the biological consequences of road building. We developed a two-dimensional framework to organize impacts of roads on aquatic biota. One dimension recognizes three phases of road development, each with distinctive ranges of spatial and temporal scales. The second dimension recognizes five classes of environmental impacts associated with road development. The framework is useful in evaluating the completeness of assessments and in identifying gaps in scientific knowledge. We applied the framework to a draft environmental impact statement (DEIS) for a proposed interstate highway to illustrate which road impacts are typically ignored in such assessments and how our framework can be used to enhance assessments. The DEIS largely omitted long-term, large-scale impacts from consideration. Such omissions preclude fair assessments of the desirability of roads and bias landscape-management decisions in favor of road building. Additional scientific input and changes in agency ide- ology are needed to reduce bias in assessments of the biological impacts of roads.},

Large-scale assessment of human activities can be useful in integrated watershed management. In this study, we modified the Ecological Risk Index (ERI) by considering the spatial distribution of human activities in China's Haihe River Basin (HRB). The stressor factors of human activities included population, impervious surface, cattle, agricultural land use, industry, fertilizers, pesticides, water conservation facilities, and roads. A total of 423 assessment units in the HRB were created by combining watershed and administrative boundaries to analyze the spatial distribution of human activities. Two index options, the ERI (including all stressors) and the ERI-D (excluding reservoirs and sluices), were examined for different management objectives. All the stressors and both ecological risk indices (ERI and ERI-D) were ranked in four levels: low, moderate, high, and very high. Our study demonstrated that the ERI and ERI-D can provide an overview of the spatial pattern of human stressors related to river ecosystems across a large geographic region. The approach developed in this study is useful for prioritizing management actions in targeted areas.},

abstract = {1.Stream and riparian ecosystems in arid montane areas, like the interior western United States, are often just narrow mesic strands, but support diverse and productive habitats. Meadows along many such streams have long been used for rangeland grazing, and, while impacts to riparian areas are relatively well known, the effect of livestock grazing on aquatic life in streams has received less attention. 2.Attempts to link grazing impacts to disturbance have been hindered by the lack of spatial and temporal replication. In this study, we compared channel features and benthic macroinvertebrate communities (i) between 16 stream reaches on two grazed allotments and between 22 reaches on two allotments where livestock had been completely removed for 4 years, (ii) before and after the 4-year grazing respite at a subset of eight sites and (iii) inside and outside of small-scale fenced grazing exclosures (eight pairings; 10+ year exclosures) in the meadows of the Golden Trout Wilderness, California (U.S.A.). 3.We evaluated grazing disturbance at the reach scale in terms of the effects of livestock trampling on per cent bank erosion and found that macroinvertebrate richness metrics were negatively correlated with bank erosion, while the percentage of tolerant taxa increased. 4.All macroinvertebrate richness metrics were significantly lower in grazed areas. Bank angle, temperature, fine sediment cover and erosion were higher in grazed areas, while riparian cover was lower. Regression models identified riparian cover, in-stream substratum, bank conditions and bankfull width-to-depth ratios as the most important for explaining variability in macroinvertebrate richness metrics. 5.Small-scale grazing exclosures showed no improvements for in-stream communities and only moderate positive effects on riparian vegetation. In contrast, metrics of macroinvertebrate richness increased significantly after a 4-year period of no grazing. 6. The success of grazing removal reported here suggests that short-term removal of livestock at the larger, allotment meadow spatial scale is more effective than long-term, but small-scale, local riparian area fencing, and yields promising results in achieving stream channel, riparian and aquatic biological recovery.},

abstract = {The relative efficiency of single-pass electrofishing of longer stream sections vs. double-pass electrofishing of shorter reaches was evaluated in small ({\textless}5 m wide) wadable lowland streams in the Lake Balaton basin, Hungary. Two hundred meters long stream sections at 8 sites were divided into ten 20 m long sampling units each. These units were used to estimate the representativeness of species richness, species composition and relative abundance data at each level of sampling effort (single vs. double-pass, and number of sampling units pooled) using rarefaction and similarity-based approaches. Assemblage variables showed strong response to the length of the stream sampled (number of sampling units pooled). However, no differences were found between the single- and double-pass methods at any level of sample size for any assemblage variable. Estimates of species richness and species occurrence distributions required more sampling effort than estimates of species relative abundances, using any evaluation method. If a proxy estimate of sample representativeness cannot be obtained in the field, a minimum sampling of single-pass electrofishing of 100 m long sections may be necessary even in small wadable streams with low level of habitat and assemblage diversity to get a relatively unbiased picture on assemblage characteristics. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {Conservation planning is the process of locating, configuring, implementing and maintaining areas that are managed to promote the persistence of biodiversity and other natural values. Conservation planning is inherently spatial. The science behind it has solved important spatial problems and increasingly influenced practice. To be effective, however, conservation planning must deal better with two types of change. First, biodiversity is not static in time or space but generated and maintained by natural processes. Second, humans are altering the planet in diverse ways at ever faster rates. {\textcopyright} 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

@article{Stoddard2005a,
abstract = {Ecological regions are areas of similar climate, landform, soil, potential natural vegetation, hydrology, or other ecologically relevant variables. The makeup of aquatic biological assemblages (e.g., fish, macroinvertebrates, algae, riparian birds, etc.) varies dramatically over the landscape, as do the environmental stresses that affect the condition of those assemblages. Ecoregions delineate areas where similar assemblages are likely to occur and, therefore, where similar expectations can be established. For this reason, ecological regions have proven to be an important tool for use in the process of ecological assessment. This article describes four examples of the use of ecological regions in important aspects of environmental monitoring and assessment: (1) design of monitoring networks; (2) estimating expected conditions (criteria development); (3) reporting of results; (4) setting priorities for future monitoring and restoration. By delineating geographic areas with similar characteristics, ecological regions provide a framework for developing relevant indicators, setting expectations through the use of regional reference sites, establishing ecoregion-specific criteria and/or standards, presenting results, focusing models based on relationships between landscape and surface water metrics, and setting regional priorities for management and restoration. The Environmental Protection Agency and many state environmental departments currently use ecoregions to aid the development of environmental criteria, to illustrate current environmental condition, and to guide efforts to maintain and restore physical, chemical and biological integrity in lakes, streams, and rivers.},

One way is to identify 'biodiversity hotspots' where exceptional concentrations of endemic species are undergoing exceptional loss of habitat. As many as 44{\%} of all species of vascular plants and 35{\%} of all species in four vertebrate groups are confined to 25 hotspots comprising only 1.4{\%} of the land surface of the Earth. This opens the way for a 'silver bullet' strategy on the part of conservation planners, focusing on these hotspots in proportion to their share of the world's species at risk.},

abstract = {Land degradation is a complex concept that integrates different aspects, including changes in soil conditions, biodiversity, productivity and socio-economic implications, compared to a reference state. We propose a new conceptual framework to analyze degradation stages and restoration thresholds in species-rich natural grasslands. The framework integrates different degradation stages with their respective thresholds and describes key processes of land-use change that lead to certain stages and thresholds. Specifically, we discuss two scenarios of grassland degradation, i.e. unsuitable grassland management and complete change of land use, sometimes followed by spontaneous recovery. We illustrate the framework with the case of south Brazilian grasslands, which are rich in biodiversity, but suffer from a series of degradation processes and are poorly considered from a conservation perspective. The conceptual framework can be applied by studies on degradation and restorability of tropical and subtropical grasslands after changes in management or transition to other land use; it will facilitate decisions on alternative management and conservation.},

abstract = {The ecomorphology of 14 fish species resident in a headwater riffles area of the S{\~{a}}o Francisco river, southeastern Brasil, was analyzed and combined with diet and feeding behavior data, previously obtained by us. The three larger species groups formed in the ecomorphological analysis were found to reflect primarily microhabitat occupation in the following manner: a) nektonic characids with compressed bodies, lateral eyes and lateral pectoral fins, with diurnal and opportunistic feeding habits (Astyanax rivularis, Bryconamericus stramineus, and Bryconamericus sp.); b) nektobenthic characiforms and siluriforms with fusiform bodies and expanded pectoral fins, including sit-and-wait characidiins, predators of aquatic insect larvae (Characidium fasciatum and Ch.zebra), as well as the algae grazing parodontids (Apareiodon ibitiensis and Parodon hilarii), and also the heptapterid and trichomycterid catfishes that practice substrate speculation and feed on benthic aquatic insect larvae (Cetopsorhamdia iheringi, Imparfinis minutus, Rhamdia quelen, and Trichomycterus sp.); c) benthic species with depressed bodies, suctorial oral discs, dorsal eyes, and horizontal pectoral fins, represented by the periphytivorous loricariid catfishes (Hisonotus sp., Harttia sp., and Hypostomus garmani). Correlation between diet and general morphology was not significant in our analysis, unless when the analyzed set included only nektonic and benthic species, indicating that the lack of correlation between these factors is most pronounced in the group of nektobenthic species. The unequivocal case of morphological convergence found between the nektobenthic Characidiinae and Parodontidae is a clear example of the integration between phylogenetic information and ecomorphology, and provides a way to objectively identify cases of morphological and adaptive convergence and divergence. Furthermore, the general congruence between the ecomorphological results and the independently obtained ecological data about the analyzed fish species in their natural environment seems to be strong evidence in favor of the proposed predictive capabilities of the ecomorphological hypothesis.},

abstract = {How does fire influence species richness and diversity in subtropical grassland in southern Brazil? Recurrently burned grassland in Porto Alegre, Brazil (3003'S, 5107'W; max. altitude 311 m a.s.l.) and abandoned grassland near S{\~{a}}o Francisco de Paula, Brazil (2947'S, 5022'W; ca. 900 m a.s.l.). In the burned grassland, between-year changes in community composition and single-plot diversity, species number and vegetation structure were analysed in two consecutive years for plots with different time since last fire. Responses to fire of individual species were analysed. At the abandoned site, diversity, species number and vegetation structure were examined. Species number and small-scale species turnover were highest ca. one year after the burn, and decreased as caespitose grasses increased in cover with time since fire until reaching a stable, but less diverse state three to four years after a fire. The abandoned grassland showed higher dominance of caespitose grasses and lower richness and diversity. Fire clearly leads to a short-term increase in species richness and diversity at the plot scale, as competitive interactions are being reduced and recruitment possibilities are high in early post-fire vegetation development. Overall community composition does not change after a fire. While small herbs seem to be slightly favoured in the early post-fire environment, no clear group of fire following species (absent in vegetation unburned for longer) was observed. The results indicate that the community is adapted to the current fire regime and is being maintained under the influence of fire.},

abstract = {Freshwater biodiversity is the over-riding conservation priority during the International Decade for Action - 'Water for Life' - 2005 to 2015. Fresh water makes up only 0.01{\%} of the World's water and approximately 0.8{\%} of the Earth's surface, yet this tiny fraction of global water supports at least 100000 species out of approximately 1.8 million - almost 6{\%} of all described species. Inland waters and freshwater biodiversity constitute a valuable natural resource, in economic, cultural, aesthetic, scientific and educational terms. Their conservation and management are critical to the interests of all humans, nations and governments. Yet this precious heritage is in crisis. Fresh waters are experiencing declines in biodiversity far greater than those in the most affected terrestrial ecosystems, and if trends in human demands for water remain unaltered and species losses continue at current rates, the opportunity to conserve much of the remaining biodiversity in fresh water will vanish before the 'Water for Life' decade ends in 2015. Why is this so, and what is being done about it? This article explores the special features of freshwater habitats and the biodiversity they support that makes them especially vulnerable to human activities. We document threats to global freshwater biodiversity under five headings: overexploitation; water pollution; flow modification; destruction or degradation of habitat; and invasion by exotic species. Their combined and interacting influences have resulted in population declines and range reduction of freshwater biodiversity worldwide. Conservation of biodiversity is complicated by the landscape position of rivers and wetlands as 'receivers' of land-use effluents, and the problems posed by endemism and thus non-substitutability. In addition, in many parts of the world, fresh water is subject to severe competition among multiple human stakeholders. Protection of freshwater biodiversity is perhaps the ultimate conservation challenge because it is influenced by the upstream drainage network, the surrounding land, the riparian zone, and - in the case of migrating aquatic fauna - downstream reaches. Such prerequisites are hardly ever met. Immediate action is needed where opportunities exist to set aside intact lake and river ecosystems within large protected areas. For most of the global land surface, trade-offs between conservation of freshwater biodiversity and human use of ecosystem goods and services are necessary. We advocate continuing attempts to check species loss but, in many situations, urge adoption of a compromise position of management for biodiversity conservation, ecosystem functioning and resilience, and human livelihoods in order to provide a viable long-term basis for freshwater conservation. Recognition of this need will require adoption of a new paradigm for biodiversity protection and freshwater ecosystem management - one that has been appropriately termed 'reconciliation ecology'.},

abstract = {* Understanding mechanisms by which agricultural practices affect freshwater ecosystems helps to inform land-use policies and management strategies aimed at mitigating effects of agriculture on biodiversity. Land-use activities in the catchment, riparian and local scales likely influence stream fish communities via multiple pathways, for instance, by modifying the instream habitat. * We investigated the mechanisms driving local stream fish taxonomic richness and functional diversity in South Brazilian grasslands by testing a theoretical path model in which we specified a priori relationships predicting how land use at multiple scales affects instream habitat and fish communities. * Agricultural activities adjacent to streams (i.e. local impact on the streambank) and catchment-scale cropland area were positively related to macrophyte cover and negatively associated with coarse particulate organic matter (CPOM, i.e. woody debris and leaf litter). Local impact also increased substrate siltation and homogenisation. Riparian vegetation in the upstream buffer ameliorated instream habitat condition by dampening macrophyte proliferation and providing CPOM. * Fish species richness increased with both macrophyte cover and CPOM, revealing multiple pathways of agricultural influence. However, functional diversity decreased only with substrate siltation, revealing a response to agricultural activities adjacent to sample sites. Agricultural streams showed a replacement of benthic and lithophilic species by a larger number of morphologically similar and macrophyte-associated nektonic fish. * Our study indicates that land-use adjacent to streams and upstream riparian zones is critical for maintaining taxonomically and functionally diverse fish communities due to their strong effects on instream habitat. Protection and recovery of riparian zones from land-use change can mitigate the effects of agriculture on fish communities in South Brazilian grasslands.},

abstract = {Restoration of riparian vegetation is widely recognized as a tool in stream rehabilitation, but information on whether local riparian characteristics can mitigate the effects of catchment-level stressors on in-stream pro- cesses is limited. We measured community metabolism in 21 streams in the Canterbury region of New Zealand along 2 independent gradients of agricultural intensity and riparian cover (from closed canopied to open canopied) to assess relative effects of landscape and local factors on stream trophic state. We measured stream metabolism with the single-station open-channel diel O2 method. We found a correlation between gross primary production (GPP) and ecosystem respiration (ER), indicating a gradient of trophic states across sites. Streams were strongly heterotrophic with P∶R values varying from 0.01 to 0.25. GPP and ER increased with {\%} agriculture and {\%} macrophyte cover, but decreased with {\%} shade from riparian vegetation. Hierarchical partitioning analysis indicated that {\%} agriculture was the only landuse variable to have a significant independent effect on GPP and ER. Among local variables, {\%} shade and {\%} macrophyte cover had significant independent effects on GPP. Percent shade was the only local variable to have a significant independent effect on ER. Percent shade had a stronger effect on both GPP and ER than did {\%} agriculture, and a trade-off exists between the importance of agricultural and forest cover on streammetabolism at different spatial scales.Our results highlight the role of local riparian conditions in controlling trophic state and the importance of riparian buffers as a tool to mitigate eutrophication in streams and rivers.},

@article{Ligeiro2013,
abstract = {Most studies dealing with the use of ecological indicators and other applied ecological research rely on some definition or concept of what constitutes least-, intermediate- and most-disturbed condition. Currently, most rigorous methodologies designed to define those conditions are suited to large spatial extents (nations, ecoregions) and many sites (hundreds to thousands). The objective of this study was to describe a methodology to quantitatively define a disturbance gradient for 40 sites in each of two small southeastern Brazil river basins. The assessment of anthropogenic disturbance experienced by each site was based solely on measurements strictly related to the intensity and extent of anthropogenic pressures. We calculated two indices: one concerned site-scale pressures and the other catchment-scale pressures. We combined those two indices into a single integrated disturbance index (IDI) because disturbances operating at both scales affect stream biota. The local- and catchment-scale disturbance indices were weakly correlated in the two basins (r = 0.21 and 0.35) and both significantly (p {\textless} 0.05) reduced site EPT (insect orders Ephemeroptera, Plecoptera, Trichoptera) richness. The IDI also performed well in explaining EPT richness in the basin that presented the stronger disturbance gradient (R2 = 0.39, p {\textless} 0.001). Natural habitat variability was assessed as a second source of variation in EPT richness. Stream size and microhabitats were the key habitat characteristics not related to disturbances that enhanced the explanation of EPT richness over that attributed to the IDI. In both basins the IDI plus habitat metrics together explained around 50{\%} of EPT richness variation. In the basin with the weaker disturbance gradient, natural habitat explained more variation in EPT richness than did the IDI, a result that has implications for biomonitoring studies. We conclude that quantitatively defined disturbance gradients offer a reliable and comprehensive characterization of anthropogenic pressure that integrates data from different spatial scales. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {Questions The co-existence of high numbers of species has always fascinated ecologists, but what and where are the communities with the world records for plant species richness? The species–area relationship is among the best-known patterns in community ecology, but does it give a consistent global pattern for the most saturated communities, the global maxima? Location The world. Methods We assembled the maximum values recorded for vascular plant species richness for contiguous areas from 1 mm2 up to 1 ha. We applied the power function to relate maximal richness to area and to make extrapolations to the whole Earth. Results Only two community types contain global plant species maxima. The maxima at smaller spatial grain were from oligo- to meso-trophic, managed, semi-natural, temperate grasslands (e.g. 89 species on 1 m2), those at larger grains were from tropical rain forests (e.g. 942 species on 1 ha). The maximum richness values closely followed a power function with z = 0.250: close to Preston's ‘canonical' value of 0.262. There was no discernable difference between maxima using rooted presence (i.e. including only plants rooted in the plot) vs shoot presence (i.e. including any plant with physical cover over the plot). However, shoot presence values must logically be greater, with the curves flattening out at very small grain, and there is evidence of this from point quadrats. Extrapolating the curve to the terrestrial surface of the Earth gave a prediction of 219 204 vascular plant species, surprisingly close to a recent estimate of 275 000 actual species. Conclusions Very high richness at any spatial grain is found only in two particular habitat/community types. Nevertheless, these high richness values form a very strong, consistent pattern, not greatly affected by the method of sampling, and this pattern extrapolates amazingly well. The records challenge ecologists to consider mechanisms of species co-existence, answers to the {\{}‘Paradox{\}} of the Plankton'.},

The present study aimed at evaluating the effects of changes in abiotic variables on the composition and structure of fish assemblages in Neotropical urban streams from southern Brazil with different levels of urbanization. The composition and structure of fish assemblages showed significant differences along the urbanization gradient observed in the streams. Tolerant and non-native species were found in more urbanized sites. A matrix correlation revealed a relationship between abiotic variables and the spatial pattern of structure and composition of fish assemblages. Abiotic variables, such as total phosphorus, dissolved oxygen, and conductivity, determined the distribution of fish assemblages. Streams without urban influence exhibited intrinsically low species richness, suggesting that they are highly susceptible to species loss and diversity reduction. Thus, changes in water quality or hydrological conditions induced by urbanization may intensify these impacts.},
